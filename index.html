						Also accout for if you are a worker on the truck. This will lower the employee cost since you don't need to hire 
						since you are the manager. But remember that means all buisness planning and getting supplies falls on you todo outside
						of regular operating hours. Expect to be working 60-80 hour work weeks. While hireing a manager is more expensive you
						don't have to do everything leaving you closer to 40-50 hoour work weeks.
